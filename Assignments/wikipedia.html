    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <hr style="width:0%"><hr/>
    <p><pre>Elon Reeve Musk FRS BBh(MT) (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor known for his key roles
in the space company SpaceX and the automotive company Tesla, Inc. Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., 
the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in the founding of the 
Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is the 
wealthiest individual in the world; as of November 2024 Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$304 billion.[4]</pre>
         <br><br/>

        Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. 
        Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship 
        through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. 
        Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.
         He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother 
         Kimbal co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million 
         in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
          In 2002, Musk acquired US citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million 
          of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.

    <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.
        [5][6] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[7][8] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman),
         is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[9][10][11] 
         His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant,
          emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private
           Nature Reserve.[12][13][14][15] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.
           [11][16] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[17][18][19]<br><br/>

        The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[15] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol
         was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[15] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to 
         receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".[20][21] Errol was elected to the 
         Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that 
         his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[5]<br><br/></p>
